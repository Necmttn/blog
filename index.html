    </h3>
    <p><p>One of my guiding principles behind RunDash's tech stack is that it should be kept as simple as possible. It is meant to return to a simpler time in web development before single page applications or microservices. That isn't to say it isn't modern though. While RunDash is not technically a single page application, full page loads are rare. You will not find webpack or React or babel in the <code>packages.json</code>.</p>

    </h3>
    <p><p>Over the last year, I've had a lot of fun tracking my progress with Garmin Connect and Strava. They expose tons of data points about each run - pace, distance, heart rate, elevation gain, cadence, etc. These tools are amazing. Strava is a great social network where my friends and I can congratulate eachother after races or particularly grueling workouts. Garmin provides insights into how training is going. Who doesn't love seeing a chart with a positive trend?</p>

    </h3>
    <p><p><a href="/posts/running-is-kinda-hard/">The last time I wrote about running was seven months ago in April 2021.</a> I had only been running for about eight weeks at that point. My longest run back then was 6.57 miles at a pace of 10:48 min/mile and I'm not even sure I ran the whole thing. Still, I was proud of that and still am! I ran pretty regularly three times a week until July when I went on a five week road trip to Seattle and back (I should write about that next). Turns out running while driving across the country, camping, and staying in the odd La Quinta Inn is tough to maintain.</p>

    </h3>
    <p><p><a href="https://www.chia.net/">Chia Network</a> is a newer blockchain and smart transaction platform that aims to be greener, more efficient, and more secure than Bitcoin and Ethereum. It is founded by Brahm Cohen, the inventor of the BitTorrent network. The project is still young - mainnet launched just seven weeks ago on March 19, 2021. Instead of using specialized hardware to &quot;mine&quot; as in Bitcoin or Ethereum, excess storage space is put to work to &quot;farm&quot;. In this post I'll share some of my thoughts since I started farming Chia.</p>

    </h3>
    <p><p>In elementary school gym class they used to make us run a half mile from the middle of a big field around a baseball field backstop, then around a tree stump some distance away and back again. It wasn't fun and I was miserable every time we did it and I've hated running since. I've always been more of a wheels guy â€” skateboarding, biking, and roller/ice hockey.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, I started running at the beginning of March 2021 - a year into the pandemic.</p>
